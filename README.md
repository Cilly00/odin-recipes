# Odin Recipes - First Project :)

Hi all - writing this before I have started the project so I can reflect on later. 

The project I am about to start is creating a basic recipe website using all I have learned so far during the HTML Foundations part of the Odin Project (Going well so far). 

After this - it will show me that I have comfortably learned how to do the basics of HTML (inserting pictures, hyperlinks, headers etc).
